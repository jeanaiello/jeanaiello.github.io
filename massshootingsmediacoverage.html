          <p>In 2023, there have been more mass shootings than days. According to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/query/0484b316-f676-44bc-97ed-ecefeabae077/map///">Gun Violence Archive</a>, there have been 165 mass shootings in the U.S. this year. That number is continuing to grow. From looking at the raw data from the Gun Violence Archive, on average, there is more than one mass shooting each day in the U.S.</p>

          <p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/26/world/us-gun-culture-world-comparison-intl-cmd/index.html///">CNN</a>, the U.S. is the only nation that has more civilian guns than people. There are 120 guns for every 100 Americans. Many other countries have stricter regulations than the U.S. for purchasing a gun. Citizens in Singapore must follow a strict process to <a href="https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/singapore///">purchase a gun</a> and crime rates in the country are some of the lowest in the world. The background check to purchase a gun in America takes only two minutes. The U.S. should implement a new and extensive <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/06/19/news/guns-background-checks/index.html///">background check</a> that requires a valid reason to purchase a gun. The right to bear arms is a part of the Constitution but so is the right to live.</p>

      <p>Of the mass shootings this year, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2023/01#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20we%20continue%20this,158%20such%20shootings%20since%202018%20///">14</a> of them have been school shootings. Innocent lives are being taken every year and the number is increasing. In July of 2022, <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/child-and-teen-firearm-mortality-in-the-u-s-and-peer-countries////">Global Health Policy</a> announced that firearms became the number one cause of death for children in the United States. Innocent children go to school and assume they will come home to their family like any other day. This has now become a hope. Parents now have to worry if their child will safely make it home from school. How have schools become danger zones?</p>

      <p>Mass shootings are the most publicized and traumatic events involving firearms. The facts state that the rate of gun deaths in the United States increased 33 percent from 2011 to 2020. On average, 40,620 people die and 76,385 are injured in the U.S. due to gun violence and it costs the country $552.2 billion per year.</p>


      <p>Children should not have this fear while sitting in class every day. Neither should college students nor anyone else. Last year, a Syracuse University student was <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2021/07/student-arrested-possession-firearms////">arrested</a> for possession of firearms on South Campus. This problem affects all of us.</p>

      <p>The media has a crucial job, as they have the role of reporting shootings to the public. They must do so in a timely and respectful way, keeping the victims and victims family in mind. Debates about how much attention the media should give to the perpetrator continue to be discussed. Should any information about who the shooter is and his background be published or does he not deserve any sort of spotlight? For the horrific act and innocent lives taken, all that the media should prioritize about the shooter is where he got the weapon and if there were signs that this act was going to occur.</p>

      <p>Greg Munno, a journalism professor at Syracuse University and former reporter and editor at the Syracuse Post-Standard and Syracuse.com, shares his thoughts on the ethics of reporting a shooting or fatal event. As a journalist, it’s crucial to prioritize the victims and victims’ families when reporting on their tragedy.</p>
      <p>“It’s really really hard because every victim and every victim’s family is different. I’ve had people yell at me because I’ve called them for quotes after they’d lost a loved one and I’ve had people yell at me because I didn’t call them for quotes…Those were the people that actually wanted to share their story,” Munno says. “So, I think we just need to approach people with that in mind and not be afraid. I think as journalists we’re so determined to act independently that we are very afraid to kind of signal to a source that they may have some control over the way we handle something. I think you can engage in a way that brings back some of the power to them."</p>

      <p>The ethics of reporting on shootings and how much information to give remains a difficult debate. How can news publications report these events sensitively, especially out of respect for the victims and victims’ families?</p>
      <p>“There’s some really tricky issues, like do we name the perpetrator of these mass shootings? I’m really divided on that. As journalists we have to have some faith that more verified, good information is better for society than less,” Munno says. “It’s such a coin flip as to what approach is more appropriate. I think it’s journalists’ job to really think carefully about these things and be ethical and be sensitive and take the consequences of what we write into consideration. But I do think we need to be at least 51% on the side of more information. As long as it’s accurate, it’s better than less.”</p>

      <p>The rate of mass shootings in 2023 is said to be "<a href="https://www.westernslopenow.com/crime/the-us-surpasses-140-mass-shootings-in-2023-heres-every-event-mapped////">outpacing</a>" the rate in 2022. It’s only getting worse since no action has been taken by the government to prevent gun violence from happening.</p>

      <p>Hamere Debebe, former Opinion Editor at The Daily Orange, believes news outlets must do better in reporting mass shootings.</p>
      <p>“Rather than having meaningful conversations, they glamorize it to their advantage to get more views or clicks,” Debebe says. “My focus as former Opinion Editor (for The Daily Orange) was to get the students’ perspective as we are the ones affected the most. Showing how frustrated and scared students are is important to the larger conversation.”</p>


      <p>In 2018, I participated in the national school <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/school-walkout.html///">walkout</a> against gun violence. At 15 years old, I was not as educated as I am now about the issue but hearing student speakers share their own trauma and experiences related to gun violence made me want to actively use my voice for change. Staying silent on issues like this is almost as disappointing as those who disagree with the enforcement of stricter gun laws.</p>

      <p>Government officials won’t acknowledge my voice on its own. Students should not dismiss the issue. The national walkout happened in 2018 but gun violence has continued, if not gotten worse, in the past four years. The conversation cannot end until the government takes action and enforces stricter gun laws.</p>
